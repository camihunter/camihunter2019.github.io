            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p>Khan Academy</p>
            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org" target="blank">khanacademy.org</a>
            <img src="images/khanacademy.jpg" alt="khanacademy homepage">
            <p>Khan Academy has done a great job using repetition on their homepage. All of their graphics are a form of
                collage using cut out images of people, rough sketched graphics, and cut out shapes of textures. As you
                scroll down the page, there are unique designs highlighting their site, yet they are all cohesive in
                their use of these elements.</p>

            <!--Column Two-->
            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p>Cafe Zupas</p>
            <a href="https://cafezupas.com/" target="blank">cafezupas.com</a>
            <img src="images/cafezupas.jpg" alt="Cafe Zupa's homepage">
            <p>The focal point on Cafe Zupas' homepage is an image with text overlay that fills most of the page. The
                image rotates between three graphics, but each of them use the rule of thirds to put their message at
                the top of the hierarchy. Your eye focuses first on the text because of the placement, then easily moves
                to explore the photograph behind the text. This also helps create a visually pleasing composition. </p>

            <!--Column Three-->
            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p>Adobe</p>
            <a href="https://www.adobe.com" target="blank">adobe.com</a>
            <img src="images/adobe.jpg" alt="adobe's homepage. Graphic of a woman's eye and a parrot swirled together.">
            <p>Adobe's whole website utilizes white space and simple black text to highlight the bright images used on
                their site. Their site is full of beautiful, complicated, and colorful graphics that could be very noisy
                if placed too close together. The big chunks of white space proved balance, and the black text grounds
                the use of color.</p>
